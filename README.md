## What problem are we adressing: 
Many new programming learners embrace themselves to learn different technologies and skills at the same time. At the early stage of their career, they experiment with different technologies to use it in real life. However, according to a research, Human memory retention and recall processes, done in University of Nottingham, pointed out that new learners often feel confident about their newly gained knowledge because they think they will remember everything. However, in reality, knowledge gained in a shooter period of time only stays in their short time memory, and never transforms into their long time memory. So, we want to solve(or attempt to solve) the problem of programmers- learning and retaining that knowledge in their long term memory.
