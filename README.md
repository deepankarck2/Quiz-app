# Quiz-it

## What problem are we adressing: 
Many new programming learners embrace themselves to learn different technologies and skills at the same time. At the early stage of their career, they experiment with different technologies to use it in real life. However, according to a research, Human memory retention and recall processes, done in University of Nottingham, pointed out that new learners often feel confident about their newly gained knowledge because they think they will remember everything. However, in reality, knowledge gained in a shooter period of time only stays in their short time memory, and never transforms into their long time memory. So, we want to solve(or attempt to solve) the problem of programmers- learning and retaining that knowledge in their long term memory. 


## How are we solving it? 
There is a psychological phenomenon known as : Retrieval aids later retention. There is clear evidence from psychological experiments that practicing retrieval of something after learning it, for instance by taking a quiz or test, makes you more likely to retain it for the long term. So our idea is to build a comprehensive Quiz Website, where learners will be able to take quizzes from a variety of topics, and test their skills. Testing also helps with finding gaps in the learning. By using our website, learners will be motivated to study the topics they donâ€™t know, and frequent testing will also help them to retain the knowledge in their long term memory.
